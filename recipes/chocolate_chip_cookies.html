        <li>Quarter-size sheet pan</li>
        <li>Wire rack</li>
        <li>Cheese cloth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bone-in Rib Roast with 3-4 bones (Choice grade is fine if you can't find Prime)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Diamond Crystal Kosher salt or 1 Tbsp table salt</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp fresh-ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp neutral oil (do not use olive oil)</li>
        <li>Cheese cloth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Trim excess fat, score a cross-hatch pattern in the fat cap</li>
        <li>Coat with oil, season liberally with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Cover in cheese cloth, place on a wire rack in a sheet pan and refrigerate for up to 1 week</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat smoker to 250 F</li>
        <li>Smoke directly on the grates rib side down fat cap up until interior hits 118 F (use a probe thermometer)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If baking in oven, use a roasting pan with wire rack</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Pull the roast, tent with foil and preheat oven or smoker to 500 F (center will continue to rise in temp as it rests)</li>
        <li>After the roast has rested at least 30 minutes and the smoker or over is to temp, return the roast to the smoker uncovered until the exterior browns deeply, 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Carefully cut the bones from the bottom of the roast and save those for the chef's leftovers.</li>
            <li>Slice generous portions, it's a special occasion after all</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Serve with freshly prepared horseradish sauce, roasted greens and potatoes</li>
        <li>If you have guests that prefer not to eat beef medium-rare, consider uninviting them from your celebration.</li>
    </ul>
