    <p>Canned baked beans are not bad. But with a few additions, they can be so much more.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For a special side dish that serves a crowd, you can’t go wrong with barbecued beans. Instead of dealing with the fuss of soaking and simmering dried beans, we cut some corners by opting for a combination of canned baked beans, pinto beans, and cannellini beans. To enliven this trio, we combined supermarket barbecue sauce, spicy brown mustard, cider vinegar, liquid smoke, garlic, and cayenne pepper. To bump up the flavor even more, we turned to Ro-Tel Original Diced Tomatoes & Green Chilies, which also added welcome heat. A hefty amount of bratwurst stirred into the beans and slices of bacon scattered over top gave us just the meaty flavor the dish needed to be complete.
